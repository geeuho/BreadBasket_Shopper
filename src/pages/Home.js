                            I'm a local bay area native with a drive to innovate and solve problems.
                            I graduated from UCSD in 2016 with a degree in General Biology, but I found out
                            my true passion was in building things. Software engineering seemed to be
                            the perfect fit. To pursue this career path, I recently graduate from Flatiron,
                            where I spent 3 months completely dedicated to learning full-stack development.
                            I learned Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and React, all of which I've become familiar with
                            through labs, coding challeneges, and team projects.

                            Using computers have always seemed cyptic to me, but I've recently found that
                            making a computer, is less like solving a math problem, and there are a ton of
                            things you can build if you just know how to speak the language. I am interested
                            in investing in the programming to continue build things that interest me.
