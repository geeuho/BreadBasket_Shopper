This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## BreadBasket Shopper Application

This application provides a realistic grocery delivery service interface, where add items to a cart, which can be checked out to create an order. These orders are sent to a server which then makes the same orders for drivers on the driver application. The application includes a realistic checkout experience where users can pay using either Paypal or the Stripe API. There a variety of familiar shopping locations to choose from, each with their own unique items, and a variety of browsing options. 

## Getting Started

There are 2 ways you can run the application. 

### 1) Run the application locally.

### Installation

To run the application locally first clone the source code onto your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:geeuho/BreadBasket_Shopper.git
cd BreadBasket_Shopper
npm install 
```

### Start

Once you've done that, you can run the following command to start the React application.

```
npm start
```

### 2) Visit the hosted website

You can also just visit the hosted live website.

## Backend

The backend that the shopper application is currently being hosted on heroku, so you don't have to run the server locally. 

This is the heroku [link]().

This is the github [link](). 

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Us

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
